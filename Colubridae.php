                echo "Largest subfamily of snakes with over 200 genera, Colubridae possesses a wide variety of snakes with lots of different body types, diets and living habits. they can be found almost everywhere on the earth and are mostly harmless. very few Colubrids actually produce venom and from the ones that do only 4 actually harm humans. allergic reactions to their bites are very rare and other than said 4 dangerous species none can actually kill a human in case of an allergic reaction but it's still best to seek medical attention in case of extreme swelling or dizziness after a colubrid bite. every venomous colubrid is rear fanged which means that to actually break skin and inject their venom which is most often just their saliva they have to chew on you and get to your skin with their often rearmost teeth and that means for a bad bite they have to chew on your body for quite some time.";

                and the ones that you actually have to be wary of are Mangrove Snakes, Asian Keelback Snakes, African Boomslangs and Twig Snakes
